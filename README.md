## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Vanilla CSS.


### What I learned

 - I used CSS media queries in a slightly different way than I did before. 
 - I haven't used different images on different sized screens before. 

### Continued development

My CSS is super messy. I need to focus more on refactoring my code. In general it's just super messy.
